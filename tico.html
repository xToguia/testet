    <h3>Mike: "The lesson is, if you're gonna be a criminal, do your homework."
        <br>
        Daniel Wormald: "Wait. I'm not a bad guy."
        <br>
        Mike: "I didn't say you were a bad guy, I said you're a criminal."
        <br>
        Daniel Wormald: "What's the difference?"
        <br>
        Mike: "I've known good criminals and bad cops. Bad priests. Honorable thieves. You can be on one side of the law or the other. But if you make a deal with somebody, you keep your word. You can go home today with your money and never do this again. But you took something that wasn't yours. And you sold it for a profit. You are now a criminal. Good one, bad one? That's up to you."</h3>
